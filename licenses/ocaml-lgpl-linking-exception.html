As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may link, 
statically or dynamically, a &quot;work that uses the OCaml Core System &quot; with a 
publicly distributed version of the OCaml Core System to produce an executable 
file containing portions of the OCaml Core System , and distribute that 
executable file under terms of your choice, without any of the additional 
requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. By 
&quot;a publicly distributed version of the OCaml Core System &quot;, we mean either the 
unmodified OCaml Core System as distributed by INRIA , or a modified version of 
the OCaml Core System that is distributed under the conditions defined in clause

invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU 
Lesser General Public License.</pre>
