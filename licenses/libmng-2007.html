  Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package.
  Although this library supports all features from the PNG specification
  (as MNG descends from it) it does not require the libpng package.
  It does require the zlib library and optionally the IJG jpeg library,
  and/or the &#34;little-cms&#34; library by Marti Maria (depending on the
  inclusion of support for JNG and Full-Color-Management respectively.
  This library&#39;s function is primarily to read and display MNG
  animations. It is not meant as a full-featured image-editing
  component! It does however offer creation and editing functionality
  at the chunk level.
  (future modifications may include some more support for creation
  and or editing)
