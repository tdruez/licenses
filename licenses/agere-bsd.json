The following statement from\nAgere clarifies the status of the firmware.

Therefore the source code can be distributed in unmodified or\nmodified form consistent with the terms of the license. The Linux driver\narchitecture was based on two modules, the MSF (Module specific functions)\nand the HCF (Hardware Control Functions). Included in the HCF is run-time\nfirmware (binary format) which is downloaded into the RAM of the Hermes\n1/2/2.5 WMAC. This hex coded firmware is not based on any open source\nsoftware and hence it is not subject to any Open Source License. The\nfirmware was developed by Agere and runs on the DISC processor embedded\nwithin the Hermes 1/2/2.5 Wireless MAC devices. Hope this helps.
