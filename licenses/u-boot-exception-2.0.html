  The U-Boot Exception:
  NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover the so-called &quot;standalone&quot;
  applications that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided

  of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of &quot;derived work&quot;.
  The header files &quot;include/image.h&quot; and &quot;include/asm-*/u-boot.h&quot; define
  interfaces to U-Boot. Including these (unmodified) header files in another
  file is considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the
