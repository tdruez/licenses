If you have\nany questions about license compatibility - consult your nearest lawyer.\nBefore incorporating code licensed under the ADI BSD license into projects\nwhich you are going to ship in a end product, you must ensure that you have\nthe patent rights to do.\n", "text_urls": ["https://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=adi_bsd"]}
