GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&#34;Exception&#34;) is an additional permission
under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (&#34;GPLv3&#34;). It
applies to a given file (the &#34;Runtime Library&#34;) that bears a notice placed by
the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3
along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC
header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of
this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by
this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an &#34;Independent Module&#34; if it either requires the Runtime Library for
execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by
the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.

&#34;GCC&#34; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU
General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions
published by the FSF.

&#34;GPL-compatible Software&#34; is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the
license of GCC.

&#34;Target Code&#34; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target
processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an
assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target
Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate
representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The &#34;Compilation Process&#34; transforms code entirely represented in non-
intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual
Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code
generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation
Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the
output of the generators or preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is &#34;Eligible&#34; if it is done using GCC, alone or with other
GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC.
For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate
representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the
Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would
otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was
generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a
combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the
Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that
third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license
of GCC.</code></pre>
