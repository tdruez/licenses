FROALA OPEN WEB DESIGN LICENSE Version 1.0 - 16 October 2017
------------------------------------------------------------

1. PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Web Design License are to stimulate worldwide development
of collaborative web design projects and to provide a free and open framework
in which web design may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The Open Web Design License allows the licensed Work to be used, studied,
modified and redistributed freely as long as it is not sold by itself. The
Work, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed
and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The Work and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license.

2. DEFINITIONS
&#34;Work&#34; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under
this license and clearly marked as such. This may include, but is not limited
to source files, build scripts and documentation.

&#34;Reserved Name&#34; refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
statement(s).

&#34;Original Version&#34; refers to the collection of Work components as distributed
by the Copyright Holder(s).

&#34;Modified Version&#34; or &#34;Derivative Work&#34; refers to any derivative made by adding
to, deleting, or substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of
the Original Version, by changing content, layout, style or by porting the Work
to a new environment.

&#34;Author&#34; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or
other person who contributed to the Work.

3. PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
the Work, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell
modified and unmodified copies of the Work, subject to the following conditions:

  a) Neither the Work nor any of its individual components, in Original or
  Modified Versions, may be (i) sold by itself; (ii) used for website or app
  generators; (iii) used to create templates, themes, and plugins for sale.

  b) Original or Modified Versions of the Work may be bundled, redistributed
  and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above
  copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
  stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
  machine-readable metadata field within text or binary files as long as those
  files can be easily viewed by the user.

  c) No Modified Version of the Work may use the Reserved Name(s) unless
  explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder.
  This restriction only applies to the primary product name as presented to the
  users.

  d) The name(s) of the Copyright holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Work shall
  not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version.

  e) The Work, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed
