notes: |
  This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual license
  COPYING dated from 2010-09-15 Per SPDX.org, Ruby is disjunctively licensed
  project that allows the choice of this license and another. The other
  license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause
  currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby License
  itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last
  substantive variation being in 2002.
