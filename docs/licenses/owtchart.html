Copyright and License Terms

OWTChart is Open Source, which means that it can be used freely, for
personnal or commercial application, as long as the authors&#39; Copyright

means 3 sets of Copyright and Distribution terms to follow.

The application part of OWTChart was developed by Daniel Morissette
(danmo@videotron.ca), and part of it was done under contract with Health
Canada. It is covered by the following Copyright and Distribution terms:
