name: ADI BSD License
category: Permissive
owner: Analog Devices

notes: |
  the home page contains these comments This is a slightly modified version
  of the three clause BSD license. It adds a clause to explicitly state the
  patent protection that this license provides (which is none). The ADI BSD
  License is similar to the Clear BSD License, which the Free Software
  Foundation indicates is compatible with both GPLv2 and GPLv3. If you have
  any questions about license compatibility - consult your nearest lawyer.
  Before incorporating code licensed under the ADI BSD license into projects
  which you are going to ship in a end product, you must ensure that you have
  the patent rights to do.
