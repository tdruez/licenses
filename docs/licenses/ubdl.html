PREAMBLE

The GNU General Public License provides a legal guarantee that
software covered by it remains free (in the sense of freedom, not
price).  It achieves this guarantee by imposing obligations on anyone
who chooses to distribute the software.

Some of these obligations may be seen as unnecessarily burdensome.  In
particular, when the source code for the software is already publicly
and freely available, there is minimal value in imposing upon each
distributor the obligation to provide the complete source code (or an
equivalent written offer to provide the complete source code).

This Licence allows for the distribution of unmodified binaries built
from publicly available source code, without imposing the obligations
of the GNU General Public License upon anyone who chooses to
distribute only the unmodified binaries built from that source code.

The extra permissions granted by this Licence apply only to unmodified
binaries built from source code which has already been made available
to the public in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public
Licence.  Nothing in this Licence allows for the creation of
closed-source modified versions of the Program.  Any modified versions
of the Program are subject to the usual terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This Licence applies to any Program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Unmodified Binary Distribution Licence.  All
terms used in the text of this Licence are to be interpreted as they
are used in version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation.

If you have made this Program available to the public in both source
code and executable form in accordance with the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version, then you are hereby granted an additional permission to use,
copy, and distribute the unmodified executable form of this Program
(the &#34;Unmodified Binary&#34;) without restriction, including the right to
permit persons to whom the Unmodified Binary is furnished to do
likewise, subject to the following conditions:

- when started running, the Program must display an announcement which
  includes the details of your existing publication of the Program
  made in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public License.
  For example, the Program could display the URL of the publicly
  available source code from which the Unmodified Binary was built.

- when exercising your right to grant permissions under this Licence,
  you do not need to refer directly to the text of this Licence, but
  you may not grant permissions beyond those granted to you by this
  Licence.
