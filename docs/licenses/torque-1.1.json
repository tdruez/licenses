The intention was\nto have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the older licensing, but\nbecause part of it was misread or accidentally ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE\nv2.5+ Software License contained commercial use restrictions which made it\nnon-free. After this issue was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the\nTORQUE upstream revised the license to remove the commercial use\nrestrictions in v1.1. The TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but\nGPL incompatible because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that\nthis license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is\nderived from OpenPBS''s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is properly dual\nlicensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that this license is not\nuseful for other codebases without removing Note 1.\n", "spdx_license_key": "TORQUE-1.1", "ignorable_copyrights": ["Copyright (c) 2010-2011 Adaptive Computing Enterprises, Inc."], "ignorable_authors": ["NASA Ames Research Center, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Veridian"], "ignorable_holders": ["Adaptive Computing Enterprises, Inc."], "ignorable_urls": ["http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/", "http://www.clusterresources.com/", "http://www.clusterresources.com/products/", "http://www.pbsworks.com/ResLibSearchResult.aspx?keywords=openpbs&industry=All&pro", "http://www.supercluster.org/mailman/listinfo/torqueusers"], "ignorable_emails": ["torque-support@adaptivecomputing.com", "torqueusers@supercluster.org"]}
