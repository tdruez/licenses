Preamble:
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which the Jetty
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance
of control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use, distribute and make reasonable modifications to the
Package in accordance with the goals and ideals of the Open Source concept as
described at http://www.opensource.org.

It is the intent of this license to allow commercial usage of the Jetty package,
so long as the source code is distributed or suitable visible credit given or
other arrangements made with the copyright holders.

Definitions:
* &#34;Jetty&#34; refers to the collection of Java classes that are distributed as a
HTTP server with servlet capabilities and associated utilities.

* &#34;Package&#34; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

* &#34;Standard Version&#34; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

* &#34;Copyright Holder&#34; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
the package.  Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd. (Australia) is the &#34;Copyright Holder&#34; for
the Jetty package.

* &#34;You&#34; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

* &#34;Reasonable copying fee&#34; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

* &#34;Freely Available&#34; means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.
