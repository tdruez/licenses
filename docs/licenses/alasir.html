    This is a free software. It&#39;s provided as-is and carries absolutely no
warranty or responsibility by the author and the contributors, neither in
general nor in particular. No matter if this software is able or unable to
cause any damage to your or third party&#39;s computer hardware, software, or any
other asset available, neither the author nor a separate contributor may be
found liable for any harm or its consequences resulting from either proper or
improper use of the software, even if advised of the possibility of certain
injury as such and so forth.

    The software isn&#39;t a public domain, it&#39;s a copyrighted one. In no event
shall the author&#39;s or a separate contributor&#39;s copyright be denied or violated
otherwise. No copyright may be removed unless together with the code
contributed to the software by a holder of the respective copyright. A
copyright itself indicates the rights of ownership over the code contributed.
Back and forth, the author is defined as the one who holds the oldest
copyright over the software. Furthermore, the software is defined as either
source or binary computer code, which is organised in the form of a single
computer file usually.

    The software, the whole or a part of it, is prohibited from being sold or
leased in any form or manner with the only possible exceptions:

a) money may be charged for a physical medium used to transfer the software;
b) money may be charged for optional warranty or support services related to
   the software.

    Nevertheless, if the software, the whole or a part of it, is expected to
become an object of sale or lease, the whole or a part of it, then a separate
non-exclusive licence agreement must be negotiated from the author. Benefits
accrued should be distributed between the contributors or likewise at the
author&#39;s discretion.

    Whenever and wherever the software is distributed, in either source or
binary form, either in whole or in part, it must include the complete
unchanged text of this licence agreement unless different conditions have been
negotiated. In case of a binary only distribution, the names of the copyright
holders must be mentioned in the documentation supplied with the software.
This is supposed to protect rights and freedom of those who have contributed
their time and labour to free software development, because otherwise the
development itself and this licence agreement are of a very little sense.

    Nothing else but this licence agreement grants you rights to use, modify
and distribute the software. Any violation of this licence agreement is
recognised as an action prohibited by an applicable legislation.</pre>
