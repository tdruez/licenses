  Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config header file, and

  The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to the FLTK

  Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not constitute a

  Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK library does not
  constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
  source code for the application or widget, use the shared FLTK libraries,
  or link their applications or widgets against a user-supplied version of
  FLTK.
  If you link the application or widget to a modified version of FLTK, then
  the changes to FLTK must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
  sections 1, 2, and 4.
  You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with programs that
  are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have to identify the FLTK
  license in your program or documentation as required by section 6 of the
  LGPL.
  However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK. The following
  example statement can be included in user documentation to satisfy this
  requirement:
  [program/widget] is based in part on the work of the FLTK project
