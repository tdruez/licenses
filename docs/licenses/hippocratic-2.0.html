Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable to the use of the Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals or groups harmed shall apply.

  2. Human Rights Principles. Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and the United Nations Global Compact (https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles) that define recognized principles of international human rights (the &#34;Human Rights Principles&#34;). It is Licensor&#39;s express intent that all use of the Software be consistent with Human Rights Principles. If Licensor receives notification or otherwise learns of an alleged violation of any Human Rights Principles relating to Licensee&#39;s use of the Software, Licensor may in its discretion and without obligation (i) (a) notify Licensee of such allegation and (b) allow Licensee 90 days from notification under (i)(a) to investigate and respond to Licensor regarding the allegation and (ii) (a) after the earlier of 90 days from notification under (i)(a), or Licensee&#39;s response under (i)(b), notify Licensee of License termination and (b) allow Licensee an additional 90 days from notification under (ii)(a) to cease use of the Software.

  3. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor&#39;s reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee&#39;s non-compliance with this License or use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles. 

* Enforceability: If any portion or provision of this License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon a determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the court may modify this License to affect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible. The section headings are for convenience only and are not intended to affect the construction or interpretation of this License. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not apply in interpreting this License. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.
