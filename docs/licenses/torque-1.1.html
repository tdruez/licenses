short_name: TORQUE 1.1
name: TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1
category: Copyleft Limited
owner: Adaptive Computing Enterprises
homepage_url: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/TORQUEv1.1
notes: |
  Per Fedora, when the licensing for TORQUE 2.4 expired, the TORQUE upstream
  drafted a new license with updated contact information. The intention was
  to have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the older licensing, but
  because part of it was misread or accidentally ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE
  v2.5+ Software License contained commercial use restrictions which made it
  non-free. After this issue was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the
  TORQUE upstream revised the license to remove the commercial use
  restrictions in v1.1. The TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but
  GPL incompatible because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that
  this license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is
  derived from OpenPBS&#39;&#39;s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is properly dual
  licensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that this license is not
  useful for other codebases without removing Note 1.
