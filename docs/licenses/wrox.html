conditions and exceptions as noted:

* Wrox Press, the authors, and distributors disclaim all warranties, express or

Press, the authors, or distributors be held responsible for any loss, damage, or
other claim caused by using the executable code or other files.

* If you use Wrox code in your application, you must acknowledge the author,
title, and Wrox in your application, software, or service&#39;s documentation and
program code itself as follows:

should only be used according to those specific terms. You should check the
