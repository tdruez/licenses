  GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

  Copyright Â© 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&#34;Exception&#34;) is an additional
  permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3
  (&#34;GPLv3&#34;). It applies to a given file (the &#34;Runtime Library&#34;) that bears a
  notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is
  governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain
  GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The
  purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including
  proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime
  libraries covered by this Exception.
  0. Definitions.
  A file is an &#34;Independent Module&#34; if it either requires the Runtime Library
  for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface
  provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime
  Library.
  &#34;GCC&#34; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
  modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the
  GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent
  versions published by the FSF.
  &#34;GPL-compatible Software&#34; is software whose conditions of propagation,
  modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the
  license of GCC.
  &#34;Target Code&#34; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
  target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to
  an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that,
  Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler
  intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate
  representation.
  The &#34;Compilation Process&#34; transforms code entirely represented in non-
  intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java
  Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of
  source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the
  Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as
  starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.
  A Compilation Process is &#34;Eligible&#34; if it is done using GCC, alone or with
  other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work
  based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize
  any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible
  Compilation Process.
  1. Grant of Additional Permission.
  You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
  the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation
  would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code
  was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a
  combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of
  the Independent Modules.
  2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
  that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the
  license of GCC.
