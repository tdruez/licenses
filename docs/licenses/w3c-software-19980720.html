This formulation of W3C&#39;s notice and license became active on August 14 1998 so
as to improve compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that W3C software
licensing terms are no more restrictive than GPL and consequently W3C software
may be distributed in GPL packages. See the older formulation for the policy
prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about
using materials from our site, including specific terms and conditions for
