Medusa, the asynchronous communications framework upon which
supervisor&#39;s server and client code is based, was created by Sam
Rushing:

  Medusa was once distributed under a &#39;free for non-commercial use&#39;
  license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed the license to be
  identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard
  Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,
  this change just frees up the rest of the system, including the http
  server, ftp server, utilities, etc.  Medusa is therefore under the
  following license:

  its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,
