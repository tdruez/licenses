3.      Trademarks and Logos. This Agreement does not authorize

4. Disclaimer of Warranty. Software is provided ``AS IS,&#39;&#39; without a
warranty of any kind. ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.

5.Limitation of Liability.      IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED
AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE
DOWNLOADING OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.      Termination.  Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time
by destroying all copies of Software. This Agreement will terminate 
immediately without notice from Sun if Customer fails to comply with 
any provision of this Agreement.  Upon such termination, Customer must 
destroy all copies of Software. Sections 4 and 5 above shall survive 
termination of this Agreement.

7.      Export Regulations. Software, including technical data, is

Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject
to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees to

re-exported (i) into, or to a national or resident of, Cuba, Iraq,
Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Syria or any country to which the U.S.

10.     Severability. If any of the above provisions are held to be in
violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived or amended to
the extent necessary for the Agreement to be otherwise enforceable in
such jurisdiction.   However, if in Sun&#39;s opinion deletion or amendment
of any provisions of the Agreement by operation of this paragraph
unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the liabilities of Sun
or its licensors, Sun reserves the right to terminate the Agreement.</pre>
