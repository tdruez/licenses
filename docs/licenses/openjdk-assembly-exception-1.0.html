  Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with other code
  is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms

  As a special exception, Oracle gives you permission to link this

  (&#34;Designated Exception Modules&#34;) to produce an executable,

  provided that the Designated Exception Modules continue to be
  governed by the licenses under which they were offered by Oracle.
  As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Oracle&#39;s GPL2 OpenJDK Code
  to build an executable that includes those portions of necessary code that
  Oracle could not provide under GPL2 (or that Oracle has provided under GPL2
  with the Classpath exception). If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code,
  that new GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception Modules
  if the new code is made subject to this exception by its copyright holder.
