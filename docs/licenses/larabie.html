    <pre id="license-text" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The fonts contained in this archive are Freeware. No payment is required for the use of these fonts.  They&#39;re free!
Commercial use?  Sure, but a donation or a product sample would be appreciated.

$40 US is the usual donation amount per font for commercial use but any amount is appreciated.

I make all the fonts (over 400 of them) on my web page and they&#39;re all free. I offer Deluxe versions of some of my
fonts for sale.  They contain several weights and styles of each font.  Just click on &#34;DELUXE FONTS&#34; at
Larabie Fonts to see them.

The site is called Larabie Fonts and it can be found at various mirror sites:

try:
http://www.larabiefonts.com
http://uk.zarcrom.com/font/
http://come.to/larabiefonts

I&#39;ve provided the world with over 400 free fonts, so if you&#39;d like to make a donation I&#39;d be more than happy to accept it.
No donation is too small.

Send anything at all to

Ray Larabie

If you decide to send a cheque (that&#39;s how we spell it in Canada) make it payable to Ray Larabie.  If you want to
double check the address have a look at the donation section on any of my webpages.  If you&#39;d like to use a credit card
to send a donation drop by my site and click on the DONATIONS section.

Canadian or US funds?  Any funds are fine with me. Whatever&#39;s easiest for you.

Here&#39;s an unofficial, non-legalese summary of the following contract:
You can use the font for commercial or non-commercial purposes. You can make things with the font, just don&#39;t change
the font itself or use it to make new fonts. You can give the font away as long as it hasn&#39;t been altered and this text file
remains with the font.  Don&#39;t remove or alter the copyright notice on the font.  Don&#39;t convert the fonts if the conversion
program alters the copyright notice.  If my font makes your hair fall out - thats&#39; too damn bad!
