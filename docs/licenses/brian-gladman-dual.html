  BrianGladman commented on Nov 9, 2015 Hi Jonas, I really wish now that I had not done this
  dual licensing as the BSD license should have been sufficient. But someone at the time wouldn&#39;t
  accept this and insisted on the GPL. You can interpret the GPL license on any of my code wherever
  it appears as &#34;ALTERNATIVELY, provided that this notice is retained in full, this product
  may be distributed under the terms of a GNU General Public License (GPL) of your choice, in
  which case the provisions of this GPL apply INSTEAD OF those given above.&#34; I hope that helps,
  if not please get back to me.
