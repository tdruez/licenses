  (WTFNMFPL or WTFNMFPLv1) is a variation on the Do What The Fuck You Want
  Public License (WTFPL) by Sam Hocevar. Essentially it is the same as the
  WTFPL, except with an additional clause to indemnify the author, creator,
  developer or distributor against anything a third party might do or
  encounter with or as a result of whatever&#39;s being licensed with it. This
  license was first published at Organised Adversary in October, 2013. The
  license is free to use by anyone as per the terms of itself.
