FreeType Project License, each contributor to the Work hereby grants 
to any individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by  
the FreeType Project License and this section (hereafter, &#34;You&#34; or

direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
