Notes
This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231

This formulation of W3C&#39;s notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on
style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is now
a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
license, and removes the ambiguous grant of &#34;use&#34;. See the older formulation for
the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions
about using materials from our site, such as the translating or annotating
specifications.</pre>
