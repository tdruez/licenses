Copyright (c) 2017 Mikhail Podgurskiy &lt;kmmbvnr@gmail.com&gt;

This Viewflow Library Exception (&#34;Exception&#34;) is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3 (&#34;AGPLv3&#34;). It applies to a viewflow library that bears a
notice placed by the copyright holder of the library stating that the
library is governed by AGPLv3 along with this Exception.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

If you modify the Program or any covered work, without changing its
source code, only by linking or combining some or all bundles of the
Program with separate works covered by AGPL- incompatible license
terms, the licensors of this Program grant you the additional
permission to convey the resulting work.

If you modify the Program, and your modified version becomes subject
to the requirement stated in AGPLv3, section 13, you may satisfy this
requirement by providing access to the Corresponding Source of your
modified version to each user that explicitly requests such
Corresponding Source, no later than 15 days following the date on
which such request was received.


2. No Weakening of Viewflow Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of Viewflow</pre>
