  GPL + java exception
  While it may be redundant, just for clarity the GPL&#39;ed code included within
  I2PTunnel and other apps must be released under the GPL with an additional
  &#34;exception&#34; explicitly authorizing the use of Java&#39;s standard libraries:
  In addition, as a special exception, XXXX gives permission to link the code
  of this program with the proprietary Java implementation provided by Sun
  (or other vendors as well), and distribute linked combinations including
  the two. You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for
  all of the code used other than the proprietary Java implementation. If you
  modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
  file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
  delete this exception statement from your version.
  All source code under each component will by default be licensed under the
  primary license, unless marked otherwise in the code. All of the above is
  summary of the license terms - please see the specific license for the
  component or source code in question for authoritative terms. Component
  source locations and resource packaging may be changed if the repository is
  reorganized.
