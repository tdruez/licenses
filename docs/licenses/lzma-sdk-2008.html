LZMA SDK is available under any of the following licenses:

1) GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL)
2) Common Public License (CPL)
3) Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) Version 1.0 
4) Simplified license for unmodified code (read SPECIAL EXCEPTION) 

It means that you can select one of these options and follow rules of that license.

1,2,3) GNU LGPL, CPL and CDDL licenses are classified as 
 - &#34;Free software licenses&#34; at http://www.gnu.org/ 
 - &#34;OSI-approved&#34; at http://www.opensource.org/

4) Simplified license for unmodified code (read SPECIAL EXCEPTION) 

Igor Pavlov, as the author of this code, expressly permits you 
to statically or dynamically link your code (or bind by name) 
to the files from LZMA SDK. 

SPECIAL EXCEPTION allows you to use LZMA SDK in applications with closed code, 
while you keep LZMA SDK code unmodified.

SPECIAL EXCEPTION #2: Igor Pavlov, as the author of this code, expressly permits 
you to use this code under the same terms and conditions contained in the License 
Agreement you have for any previous version of LZMA SDK developed by Igor Pavlov.

SPECIAL EXCEPTION #2 allows owners of proprietary licenses to use latest version 
of LZMA SDK as update for previous versions.

Some files in LZMA SDK are placed in public domain.
Some of these &#34;public domain&#34; files:
C\Types.h,
C\LzmaLib.*
C\LzmaLibUtil.*
LzmaAlone.cpp, 
LzmaAlone.cs, 
LzmaAlone.java

So you can change them as you want and use &#34;SPECIAL EXCEPTION&#34; 
for other unmodified files. For example, you can edit C\Types.h to solve some 
compatibility problems with your compiler.
