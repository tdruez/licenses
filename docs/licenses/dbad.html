DON&#39;T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Do whatever you like with the original work, just don&#39;t be a dick.

Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don&#39;t just copy this and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that&#39;s REALLY being a dick.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work&#39;s creator(s) a pint.

Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else&#39;s code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
