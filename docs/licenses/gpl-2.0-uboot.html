The U-Boot Exception:

NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover the so-called &#34;standalone&#34;
applications that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table
provided by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered
normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of &#34;derived
work&#34;.

The header files &#34;include/image.h&#34; and &#34;include/asm-*/u-boot.h&#34; define
interfaces to U-Boot. Including these (unmodified) header files in
another file is considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall
under the heading of &#34;derived work&#34;.

Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the U-Boot
source code) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.
