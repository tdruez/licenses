Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

    &#34;Package&#34; refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
    created through textual modification.

    &#34;Standard Version&#34; refers to such a Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
    Copyright Holder as specified below.

    &#34;Copyright Holder&#34; is whoever is named in the copyright or
    copyrights for the package.

    &#34;You&#34; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this
    Package.

    &#34;Distribution fee&#34; is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this
    Package to another party.

    &#34;Freely Available&#34; means that no fee is charged for the right to use
    the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. 
    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
    the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from
the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be
considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least
ONE of the following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
    them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
    Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
    major network archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or
    by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in
    the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
    organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified
    Package permission to make your modifications Freely Available in
    some specific way.


4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
    files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
    on where to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your
    modifications, by mail order.

5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this
Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee
you choose for that support.  You may not charge a license fee for the
right to use this Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in
aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs
as part of a larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software
distribution, and charge license fees for other parts of that software
distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You may
embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by
linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation,
provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so
embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and
may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If
such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
so-called &#34;undump&#34; or &#34;unexec&#34; methods of producing a binary executable
image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as
a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an
executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall
not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input
as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language
in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the
language.

8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package
is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this
Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial
distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this
Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &#34;AS IS&#34; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
