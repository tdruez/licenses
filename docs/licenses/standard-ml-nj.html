notes: |
  per SPDX.org, SPDX ended up with this license on the license list twice
  once as of v1.17 with the short identifier SMLNJ and then added (again) as
  of v1.20 with the short identifier StandardML-NJ. The former list entry has
  been deprecated. Here, this license is not verbatim the SPDX SMLMJ, but
  instead the more generic variant as used in the Java CUP parser generator
  that has no specific references to Lucent and Bell Labs and is therefore a
  better choice for reuse.
