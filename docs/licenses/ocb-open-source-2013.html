1 Definitions
1.1 &#34;Licensor&#34; means Phillip Rogaway.
1.2 &#34;Licensed Patents&#34; means any patent that claims priority to United States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled &#34;Method and Apparatus for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,&#34; and any utility, divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination, reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675; and any patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.
1.3 &#34;Use&#34; means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.
1.4 &#34;Software Implementation&#34; means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on a userprogrammable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a computerreadable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), fieldprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.
1.5 &#34;Open Source Software&#34; means software whose source code is published and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify, and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9, 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these requirements for the purposes of this license.
1.6 &#34;Open Source Software Implementation&#34; means a Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is not Open Source Software.
