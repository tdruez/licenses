  1) Any reference, whether in these modifications or in the GNU
  Library General Public License 2.1, to this License, these terms, the
  GNU Lesser Public License, GNU Library General Public License, LGPL, or
  any similar reference shall refer to the GNU Library General Public
  License 2.1 as modified by these paragraphs 1) through 4).
  2) Static linking of programs with the libwebsockets library does not
  constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
  source code for the program, use the shared libwebsockets libraries, or
  link their program against a user-supplied version of libwebsockets.
  If you link the program to a modified version of libwebsockets, then the
  changes to libwebsockets must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
  sections 1, 2, and 4.
  3) You do not have to provide a copy of the libwebsockets license with
  programs that are linked to the libwebsockets library, nor do you have to
  identify the libwebsockets license in your program or documentation as
  required by section 6 of the LGPL.
  However, programs must still identify their use of libwebsockets. The
  following example statement can be included in user documentation to
  satisfy this requirement:
  &#34;[program] is based in part on the work of the libwebsockets project
  (https://libwebsockets.org)&#34;
  4) Some sources included have their own, more liberal licenses, or options
  to get original sources with the liberal terms.
  Original liberal license retained
  - lib/sha-1.c - 3-clause BSD license retained, link to original
  - win32port/zlib - ZLIB license (see zlib.h)
  - lib/mbedtls_wrapper - Apache 2.0 (only built if linked against mbedtls)
  Relicensed to libwebsocket license
  - lib/base64-decode.c - relicensed to LGPL2.1+SLE, link to original
