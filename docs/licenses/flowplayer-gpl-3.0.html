The Flowplayer Free version is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3 (GPL). Our GPL based license requires that you do not remove the
copyright notices or author attribution from the player&#39;s user interface. These
are present in the player canvas (bottom left corner) and in the context menu.
See license FAQ for more details.

Commercial licenses are available. The commercial player version does not
require any Flowplayer notices or texts and also provides some additional
features.

ADDITIONAL TERM per GPL Section 7

If you convey this program (or any modifications of it) and assume contractual
liability for the program to recipients of it, you agree to indemnify
Flowplayer, Ltd. for any liability that those contractual assumptions impose on
Flowplayer, Ltd.

Except as expressly provided herein, no trademark rights are granted in any
trademarks of Flowplayer, Ltd. Licensees are granted a limited, non-exclusive
right to use the mark Flowplayer and the Flowplayer logos in connection with
unmodified copies of the Program and the copyright notices required by section
5.d of the GPL license. For the purposes of this limited trademark license
grant, customizing the Flowplayer by skinning, scripting, or including plugins

Licensees that do modify the Program, taking advantage of the open-source
license, may not use the Flowplayer mark or Flowplayer logos and must change the

stating that the licensee modified the Flowplayer. A suitable notice might read
&#34;Flowplayer Source code modified by ModOrg 2012&#34;; for the canvas, the notice
should read &#34;Based on Flowplayer source code&#34;.

In addition, licensees that modify the Program must give the modified Program a
new name that is not confusingly similar to Flowplayer and may not distribute it
under the name Flowplayer.</pre>
