Definitions of terms

    &#34;PRODUCT&#34; refers to the product offered by Dynarch.com (the object of this license agreement).
    &#34;LICENSEE&#34; refers to the one that has downloaded the PRODUCT package. Sometimes we might use &#34;you&#34; as a synonym.

License agreement

LICENSEE is NOT allowed to modify or remove any copyright notices from any of the PRODUCT files.

Subject to the terms of this agreement, Dynarch.com grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, free license to use the PRODUCT on Sites that you own, under the following terms and conditions:

(1) Non-commercial.  Sites that use the PRODUCT under this license (&#34;Sites&#34;) must be non-profit; examples of accepted websites are free or hobby Websites, blogs, charity organizations or universities, or websites of open source projects.

Sites may contain advertising, as long as they are not published for the specific purpose of showing ads.  We will not accept spam sites.

The Sites may not include:

    Pornography, adult, or mature content
    Gambling or casino-related content

If you are not sure that your Site follows our policy, you must ask us.

(2) Link back.  Sites using the PRODUCT under this license must link back to the PRODUCT home page, in each page where the PRODUCT is used. The link must be visible and direct.

Example of acceptable code:

   title=&#34;Visit the DHTML Menu Page&#34;&gt;
  DHTML Menu by Dynarch.com
&lt;/a&gt;

You can include a target=&#34;_blank&#34; attribute if you wish.

You may place the link anywhere in the page, the main requirement is that it must be visible and that it should point directly to the PRODUCT page—server-side redirects are not acceptable.

Please refer to the file linkware.html in the PRODUCT package for more details on this, after you download the PRODUCT.

(3) No Intranet.  This free license does not cover usage on your Intranet—for that you need to purchase a commercial license.

(4) No distribution.  You may not distribute the PRODUCT nor any derivative works to any third party.  You may not distribute free nor commercial Software applications or Libraries that incorporate the PRODUCT.
