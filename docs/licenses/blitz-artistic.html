(with thanks and apologies to authors of the Perl Artistic License)

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which 
Blitz++ may be copied, such that the authors maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and
distribute Blitz++ in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the
right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions

`Library&#39; refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
created through textual modification.

`Standard Version&#39; refers to such a Library if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.

Copyright Holder&#39; is whoever is named in the copyright or
copyrights for the package.

`You&#39; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying, modifying or
distributing this Library.

`Freely Available&#39; means that no fee is charged for the item.
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it 
under the same conditions they received it.

``Reasonable copying fee&#39;&#39; is whatever you can justify on the basis
of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the 
Standard Version of this Library without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices, this license,
and associated disclaimers. 

2. The Standard Version of the Library may be distributed as part
of a collection of software, provided no more than a reasonable
copying fee is charged for the software collection.

3. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
Library modified in such a way shall still be considered the
Standard Version.

4. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Library in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:

a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
modifications to the Blitz++ development list, 
and allowing the Copyright Holder to include
your modifications in the Standard Version of the Library.

b. use the modified Library only within your corporation or
organization. 

c. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright
Holder.

5. You may distribute programs which use this Library
in object code or executable form without restriction.

6. Any object code generated as a result of using this Library 
does not fall under the copyright of this Library, but
belongs to whomever generated it, and may be sold commercially.

7. The name of the Copyright Holder or the Library may not be used to 
endorse or promote products derived from this software without 
specific prior written permission.

8. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED `AS IS&#39; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
