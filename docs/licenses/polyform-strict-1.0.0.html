## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software
to do everything you might do with the software that would
otherwise infringe the licensor&#39;s copyright in it for any
permitted purpose, other than distributing the software or
making changes or new works based on the software.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for
the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private
entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious
observance, without any anticipated commercial application,
is use for a permitted purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution,
public research organization, public safety or health
organization, environmental protection organization,
or government institution is use for a permitted purpose
regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting
from the funding.

## Fair Use

You may have &#34;fair use&#34; rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
