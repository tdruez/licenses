  <pre>There are no restrictions on the use of newran except that I take no liability for any problems that may arise from its use.

I welcome its distribution as part of low cost CD-ROM collections.

You can use it in your commercial projects. However, if you distribute the source, please make it clear which parts are mine and that they are available essentially for free over the Internet.</pre>
