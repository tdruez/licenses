The one significant difference is that where the\nSleepycat License says The source code must either be included in the\ndistribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus\na nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable\nconditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source code must either be\nincluded in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no\nmore than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely\nredistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While\nthe Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license,\nTOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the \"no more\nrestrictive\" language.\n", "spdx_license_key": "TOSL", "ignorable_copyrights": ["copyright (c) 2006 Mike Mintz and Robert Ekendahl"], "ignorable_holders": ["Mike Mintz and Robert Ekendahl"]}
